These datasets are useful for practicing and experimenting with various machine learning algorithms and techniques. They cover a wide range of domains, including classification, regression, clustering, and more.\r\n",

    "- Iris: The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers. It is commonly used for classification tasks.\r\n",
    "- Breast Cancer: The Breast Cancer dataset provides features derived from digitized images of breast mass aspirates. It is often used for binary classification tasks to diagnose breast cancer.\r\n",
    "- Boston Housing: The Boston Housing dataset contains information about housing prices in Boston based on various features like crime rate, number of rooms, etc. It is commonly used for regression tasks.\r\n",
