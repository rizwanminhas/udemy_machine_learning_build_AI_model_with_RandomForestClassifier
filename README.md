# Udemy | Machine Learning Build AI Model With RandomForestClassifier

In this exercise I have used the breast cancer dataset from the scikit learn and used the RandomForestClassifier to find out relationship between the features and their importance.

This example exercise covers following topics:

1. How to create a dataset.
2. How to split data for training and testing.
3. How/What/Why of RandomForestClassifier.
4. How to check the accuracy of a Model.
5. How to create a heat map for a confusion matrix.
6. How to find out the importance of features (e.g. in this exercise which attributes are the most likely symptoms of breast cancer).
7. How to sort arguments and arrays in asc and desc order.
8. How to create a bar chart.
