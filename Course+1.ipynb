    "Scikit-learn provides a collection of built-in datasets that are commonly used for machine learning tasks. These datasets are useful for practicing and experimenting with various machine learning algorithms and techniques. They cover a wide range of domains, including classification, regression, clustering, and more.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When you import `datasets` from scikit-learn, you gain access to these built-in datasets. Some of the popular datasets available in scikit-learn include:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- Iris: The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers. It is commonly used for classification tasks.\r\n",
    "- Breast Cancer: The Breast Cancer dataset provides features derived from digitized images of breast mass aspirates. It is often used for binary classification tasks to diagnose breast cancer.\r\n",
    "- Boston Housing: The Boston Housing dataset contains information about housing prices in Boston based on various features like crime rate, number of rooms, etc. It is commonly used for regression tasks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "By importing `datasets` from scikit-learn, you can load these datasets into your Python code and use them for training models, testing algorithms, or exploring machine learning machine learning tasks."
